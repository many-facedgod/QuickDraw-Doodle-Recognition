# Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition
An attempt at the [Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition). We present an ensemble of a BiLSTM and a ResNet-18, which achieves a MAP@3 score of 0.917 on the Kaggle leaderboard on training with just 10% of the data.

This project was undertaken as a part of the [Fall-2018 Introduction to Deep Learning](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/) course offered by the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. The preprocessed dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CUkYNfk8IfRgpz9fqNWiDAwk_dS6BGV3) and the trained model can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bBmjaKWSNb7y_voftOzuHnTJpPP9FpMl).
